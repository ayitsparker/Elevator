Elevator class implementation for unnamed coding assignment
Created on Ubuntu 20.04 WSL2 x86 and Python3.10(CPython GCC 11.4)

Simple python script to mimic basic elevator inputs and outputs. Can be run standalone via `python3 scripts/main.py`

Of note constructor param `num_floors` can be changed to edit number of valid floor range. Likewise the param stop_at_floor can be change to indicate if extra input should be allowed at each floor. 
Extra assumptions and thoughts are given as a block comment at the top of the source file.
